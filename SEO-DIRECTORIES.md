# Directory Submission Strategy

## Tier 1 — Direct competitors/peers (get listed alongside them)

These sites do the same thing as us. Being listed near them = highly relevant backlink + discovery.

- **[Quizz.biz](https://www.quizz.biz/annuaire/cat-quizz-22_0.html)** — Huge French quiz directory, has a "Politique" category. Submit a quiz or get the site referenced
- **[Politest.fr](http://www.politest.fr/)** — Political positioning test
- **[PolitiScales](https://politiscales.party/)** — Another political test
- **[POLITEIA / test-politique.fr](https://www.test-politique.fr/)** — "Le nouveau test politique"
- **[Théo Soyer](https://www.theosoyer.fr/)** — Independent political quiz

Action: Contact these sites to suggest a mutual link or a "see also" section. We're not competitors, we're complements.

## Tier 2 — Civic Tech / Democracy directories

- **[Décider Ensemble](https://www.deciderensemble.com/observatoire)** — They maintain a "Référentiel des civic tech actives en France" (32 organizations listed). Ask to be included as a civic engagement tool
- **[CivicTechno.fr](http://civictechno.fr/)** — French civic tech blog/directory
- **[ConsoGlobe — 20 outils civic tech](https://www.consoglobe.com/civic-tech-cg)** — Curated list article, pitch an update to include us

## Tier 3 — Indie maker / French tech directories

- **[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com)** — Still worth a launch even if not French-specific
- **[Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com)** — Post in the community, show the project
- **[MyFrenchStartup](https://www.myfrenchstartup.com/fr/)** — 30k French startups listed
- **[BetaList](https://betalist.com)** — Good for discovery

## Tier 4 — Wikipedia (high authority)

- The **Wikipedia article on [Technologie civique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologie_civique)** lists civic tech tools. If the quiz qualifies (notable enough, press coverage), adding it to the "liens externes" section is a very high-value link

## Action plan for contributors

1. **Contact Tier 1 sites** — Email each one, propose mutual linking ("hey, we both make political quizzes, want to link to each other?")
2. **Apply to Tier 2 directories** — Fill out the Décider Ensemble form, pitch to CivicTechno
3. **Post on Tier 3 platforms** — Write a short story about why you built the quiz
4. **Wikipedia** — Only if there are press articles to cite as sources (Wikipedia requires notability)

10-15 quality, relevant links > 500 generic directory submissions.
